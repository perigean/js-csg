I'm trying to implement a 2d CSG algorithm for JavaScript

The algorithm pushes polygons through a BSP tree, so it only supports subtraction (for now?).

polygons are themselves stored on branches of a bsp tree, so collision detection and csg operations will be easy.

Lost of stuff to do, but need source control first...
