I'm trying to implement a 2d CSG algorithm for JavaScript

The algorithm pushes triangle meshes through a BSP tree, so it only supports subtraction (for now?).

The triangle mesh structure should eventually be a superset of a WebGL indexed triangle list, so display will be easy.

Lost of stuff to do, but need source control first...
